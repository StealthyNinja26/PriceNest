# 🏠 PriceNest

This project is a comprehensive data science portfolio piece focused on analyzing and predicting house prices across Ireland using real-world data. Leveraging a 2024 housing dataset from Kaggle, it applies exploratory data analysis (EDA), classification, regression, and a user-friendly Streamlit application to showcase the insights and predictions. The aim is to provide both technical and practical value in understanding property trends and forecasting home values using machine learning.

Note: regression_model.pkl could not be uploaded due to size contraints. While running `eda_irish_housing.ipynb` locally, you will generate all required files.

# 📋✔️🧾 Requirements

Files required to run `eda_irish_housing.ipynb` are :
* `ireland-house-properties-dataset-2024.csv`

This should generate the following files :
* `cleaned_ireland_house_prices.csv`
* `classification_model.pkl`
* `regression_model.pkl`

After receiving the required files run `app.py` locally (scroll further to see how)

## 📁 Project Structure

```
├── eda_irish_housing.ipynb        # EDA, data cleaning, feature engineering
├── classification_model.pkl       # Trained classification model (joblib)
├── regression_model.pkl           # Trained regression model (joblib)
├── app.py                         # Streamlit GUI application
├── cleaned_ireland_house_prices.csv # Cleaned dataset ready for feature engineering
├── ireland-house-properties-dataset-2024.csv # Raw dataset from Kaggle
└── README.md                      # This file
```

Each component plays a distinct role in building the pipeline from raw data to interactive prediction tools. The notebooks explore the data and prepare it for model training, while the `.pkl` files store the trained models. The Streamlit app (`app.py`) ties everything together into a smooth, graphical experience.

## 📊 Dataset Overview

* **Source:** [Kaggle - Ireland House Properties Dataset 2024](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adnankhalid007/ireland-house-properties-dataset-2024)
* **Size:** Thousands of listings for properties sold or listed across various counties in Ireland.
* **Columns include:**

  * Property Type (Apartment, Detached, etc.)
  * Bedrooms, Bathrooms
  * County (Dublin, Galway, Cork, etc.)
  * BER Rating (Energy efficiency)
  * Size (in square meters)
  * Price (target variable)

This rich dataset allows both regression and classification tasks, offering a versatile platform for modeling.

## 🧠 Machine Learning Models

### 1. 🏷️ Classification

* **Goal:** Predict a price category label such as Low, Medium-Low, Medium, Medium-High, or High.
* **Method:** Custom ordinal encoding to reflect economic ordering of price categories. Trained using a supervised learning algorithm on preprocessed features including size, location, amenities, and BER.

### 2. 💶 Regression

* **Goal:** Predict the actual price of a home in euros.
* **Method:** Standard regression pipeline using numeric and encoded categorical features. It captures trends in housing size, region, and property type to estimate market value.

## 🚀 Streamlit Web App

The Streamlit app serves as an accessible way for users to interact with the trained models. It has two primary functionalities:

* **📊 Predict Price Category:**

  * Users fill in a property’s attributes and get a prediction on which price tier the house would likely fall into.

* **💶 Predict Price Value:**

  * Using the same inputs, the regression model estimates a euro value for the house based on learned trends in the training data.

### ▶️ To Run the App Locally:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```

This launches a local server where users can interactively test different housing scenarios.

## 🛠️ Features & Techniques

* Data Cleaning: Addressing missing values, data types, and erroneous outliers
* Feature Engineering: One-hot encoding, ordinal categorization, boolean transformations
* Model Training: Scikit-learn pipelines with train/test splits and validation
* Model Persistence: Export and reuse trained models using `joblib`
* Streamlit Interface: A responsive, clean UI built with Streamlit widgets to gather user input
* Custom Category Decoding: Manual mapping used instead of `LabelEncoder` for more controlled results

These steps ensure a robust pipeline that bridges raw data to usable prediction tools.
